# Statistical-Analysis-of-Colorectal-Cancer-Patients
*A R Markdown analysis report Colorectal Cancer patients*

This project served as a midterm assessment for STAT 385 (Statistical Programming Methods). The goal of this midterm assessment was to create a R markdown report using various  statistical analysis to make conclusions regarding Colorectal Cancer patients, as well as visualizing said statistical analysis. The final conclusion was to see what single factor has the largest impact on tumor size. The markdown template was designed to be dynamic so data and factors could easily be changed. 

## Core tenants of this project include:
- Statistical Analysis
- Statistical Modeling
- ANOVA Testing
- Data Visualization
- Markdown Report Generating

## Tools for this project included:
- R
- Markdown

## Insights:
- Smoking History and Physical Activity on their own have a significant effect on colorectal cancer tumor sizes, however an interaction of the two do not
- Cancer Stage and Physical Activity are two very good indicators of colorectal cancer tumor sizes
- The single biggest factor that affects tumor size is alcohol consumption
